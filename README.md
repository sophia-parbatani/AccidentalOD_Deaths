# Why did we choose this data?
Accidental drug overdoses are the most common type of drug related death 
65.9% of drug OD deaths had at least one potential opportunity for intervention (cdc.gov)
Current fentanyl crisis
Accidental OD’s affect a broad range of demographics
At our class's current age (20's), the likelihood for an accidental OD starts to rise quickly, peaking at 36 yrs old.
# Our Questions and why they are important
1) __Is there a trend among age and sex relevant to drug that causes the OD?__
	
 -Clusters of a population often frequent the same areas/activities

-Ex.) 16 yr old male/female – this cluster commonly attends high school

-Targeted resources/intervention for the specific drug affecting given population the most


2) __What proportion of total accidental ODs show traces of fentanyl in the tox screen? Does this vary by county?__

 -The head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Anne Milgram, said that “fentanyl is the single deadliest drug threat our nation has ever encountered.”

-Fentanyl is the top killer among all demographics in drug overdose deaths

-Finding the locations where fentanyl is most common in tox screens could indicate problem areas to public health officials as well as law enforcement. 

-Higher percentage tox containing trace amounts of fentanyl = possible import/activity hotspots
# Manipulations applied to the data set question #1
-Filtered records to include only cases where drug involvement = ‘Y’ (confirmed overdoses)
-Pivoted drug columns into a single “Drug Type” field for multi-drug comparison
-Created age bins (10-year intervals) for grouped demographic analysis
-Counted records to show overdose frequency by age, sex, and drug
-Renamed fields and aliases for clarity (e.g., 10 → 0–10, Pivot Field Names → Drug Type

# Manipulations applied to the data set question #2
-Created a New "record count" field for total deaths 
-Used Generated Longitude and Latitude in columns and rows, overall filtered by fentanyl 
-Used color to indicate percentage of total amount of ODs fentanyl respresented 
-Used text to indicate amount of deaths and county names
