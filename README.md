# Why did we choose this data?
Accidental drug overdoses are the most common type of drug related death
65.9% of drug OD deaths had at least one potential opportunity for intervention (cdc.gov)
Current fentanyl crisis
Accidental OD’s affect a broad range of demographics
At our class's current age (20's), the likelihood for an accidental OD starts to rise quickly, peaking at 36 yrs old.
# Our Questions and why they are important
1) __Is there a trend among age and sex relevant to drug that causes the OD?__
	
 - Clusters of a population often frequent the same areas/activities

- Ex.) 16 yr old male/female – this cluster commonly attends high school

- Targeted resources/intervention for the specific drug affecting given population the most


2) __What proportion of total accidental ODs show traces of fentanyl in the tox screen? Does this vary by county?__

 - The head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Anne Milgram, said that “fentanyl is the single deadliest drug threat our nation has ever encountered.”

- Fentanyl is the top killer among all demographics in drug overdose deaths

- Finding the locations where fentanyl is most common in tox screens could indicate problem areas to public health officials as well as law enforcement. 

- Higher percentage tox containing trace amounts of fentanyl = possible import/activity hotspots
